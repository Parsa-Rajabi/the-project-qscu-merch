                <p class="QSCUbio">Since 2011, the <a href="http://qscu.org">Quantitative Science Course Union</a> has been representing UBC Okanagan students in Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics, and Physics and Data Science. The QSCU organizes both fun and educational events while also assisting first-year students in their courses. These events are usually held on campus. The course union strives to bring students and professors together in a casual atmosphere in hopes of creating social networking and research opportunities.
